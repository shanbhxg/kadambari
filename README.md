# Kadambari, your lightweight book logging website.

Kadambari is a minimal website that lets you log your books the way you want to. With a large suite of options, the goal of Kadambari is to let you choose how you want to log your books. Mainly, this is an attempt towards a private log to save your thoughts on each book. Very similar to a pen and paper log, just backed up over the internet so you don't lose it.
